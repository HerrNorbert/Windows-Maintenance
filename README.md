## Defragment and Optimize Drives
This tool run automaticly in the background and has the biggest impact on HDD-s. When we delete a file, its actually not erased from the disc, just signed that part of the drive can be overwritten. After a while there will be holes in our data and become more complex to read to the computer and takes longer time.
Imagine a 3 people's ToDO list in one messy list like:
| Owner | ID | Description | 
|:---------|----|-----:|
|Peter|1|Take a nap|
|Stewee|1|Kill Lois|
||||
|Stewee|3|Make Brian upset|
|Peter|2|Drink a beer|
|Stewee|2|Take over the world|

If I want to get Peter's ToDos I have to jump 3 lines to get the 2nd one. The defragger will straighten up.
| Owner | ID | Description |
